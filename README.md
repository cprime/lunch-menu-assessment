# Lunch Menu Assessment

Welcome to the Technical Phone Assessment! This project is a starting point for the below problem.

## The Project

This project will serve as a starting point in the interview process. Once this project has been evaluated by our engineering team, you may be invited for a full panel interview with various members of the team. At the full panel interview, we'll review this project with you and ask you to enhance it with a new set of requirements. 

As you tackle this problem, keep in mind we'll be looking for the following:

* Code structure and software architecture principles
* Ability to navigate ambiguous requirements
* Your unique strengths as a software engineer

At the end of this session, make sure you push what you've completed and your interview has access to your repo.

## The Problem

At Company X, we really enjoy our catered lunches. We use a rotating schedule for the lunch menu, but it has been tricky for us to keep track of it. To help us plan our week, we'd like an app that displays the lunch schedule on a calendar. You'll find the raw lunch schedule data below.

### Rotating Lunch Schedule

* Week 1
  * Monday - Chicken and waffles
  * Tuesday - Tacos
  * Wednesday - Curry
  * Thursday - Pizza
  * Friday - Sushi
* Week 2
  * Monday - Breakfast for lunch
  * Tuesday - Hamburgers
  * Wednesday - Spaghetti
  * Thursday - Salmon
  * Friday - Sandwiches

## Starting Point

This project has a few things set up for you to start (detailed below), but don't feel glued to them. If there's something we didn't include, feel free to add it as a, and if there something we added that you don't want to use, it's not required that you use it!

* AppDelegates/SceneDelegate.swift **IMPORTANT**
  * Go to `scene(_:willConnectTo:session:options:connectionOptions)`
    * There are two options to get started - MainUIKitViewController & MainSwiftUIHostController
    * Update the rootViewController by uncommenting a line to get started with either a UIKit or SwiftUI approach
    * Note: Your selection does not affect the assessment
* MainUIKitViewController.swift
  * A blank `ViewController` that new UI can be placed into
* MainSwiftUIHostController.swift
  * A blank `UIHostingController` that new SwiftUI can be placed into 
* Data/LunchMenuDataSource.swift
  * This is where you'll access the above menu. We've provided a very basic faked async resource that returns it's data after a 3 second delay to simulate a network request.
